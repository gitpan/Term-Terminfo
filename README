NAME
    "Term::Terminfo" - access the terminfo database

SYNOPSIS
     use Term::Terminfo;

     my $ti = Term::Terminfo->new;

     printf "This terminal %s do overstrike\n",
        $ti->getflag('os') ? "can" : "cannot";

     printf "Tabs on this terminal are initially every %d columns\n",
        $ti->getnum('it');

DESCRIPTION
    Objects in this class provide access to terminfo database entires.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $ti = Term::Terminfo->new( $termtype )
    Constructs a new "Term::Terminfo" object representing the given
    termtype. If $termtype is not defined, $ENV{TERM} will be used instead.
    If that variable is empty, "vt100" will be used.

METHODS
  $bool = $ti->getflag( $capname )
    Returns the value of the named boolean capability.

  $num = $ti->getnum( $capname )
    Returns the value of the named numeric capability.

  $str = $ti->getstr( $capname )
    Returns the value of the named string capability.

TODO
    This distribution provides a small accessor interface onto terminfo. It
    was originally created simply so I can get at the "bce" capability flag
    of the current terminal, because screen unlike every other terminal
    ever, doesn't do this. Grrr.

    It probably also wants more accessors for things like "tparm" and
    "tputs". I may at some point consider them.
