NAME
    "Term::Terminfo" - access the terminfo database

SYNOPSIS
     use Term::Terminfo;

     my $ti = Term::Terminfo->new;

     printf "This terminal %s do overstrike\n",
        $ti->getflag('os') ? "can" : "cannot";

     printf "Tabs on this terminal are initially every %d columns\n",
        $ti->getnum('it');


     printf "This terminal %s do overstrike\n",
        $ti->flag_by_varname('over_strike') ? "can" : "cannot";

     printf "Tabs on this terminal are initially every %d columns\n",
        $ti->num_by_varname('init_tabs');

DESCRIPTION
    Objects in this class provide access to terminfo database entires.

    This database provides information about a terminal, in three separate
    sets of capabilities. Flag capabilities indicate the presence of a
    particular ability, feature, or bug simply by their presence. Number
    capabilities give the size, count or other numeric detail of some
    feature of the terminal. String capabilities are usually control strings
    that the terminal will recognise, or send.

    Capabilities each have two names; a short name called the capname, and a
    longer name called the varname. This class provides two sets of methods,
    one that works on capnames, one that work on varnames.

    This module optionally uses unibilium to access the terminfo(5)
    database, if it is available at compile-time. If not, it will use
    <term.h> and -lcurses. For more detail, see the "SEE ALSO" section
    below.

CONSTRUCTOR
  $ti = Term::Terminfo->new( $termtype )
    Constructs a new "Term::Terminfo" object representing the given
    termtype. If $termtype is not defined, $ENV{TERM} will be used instead.
    If that variable is empty, "vt100" will be used.

METHODS
  $bool = $ti->getflag( $capname )
  $num = $ti->getnum( $capname )
  $str = $ti->getstr( $capname )
    Returns the value of the flag, number or string capability of the given
    capname.

  $bool = $ti->flag_by_varname( $varname )
  $num = $ti->num_by_varname( $varname )
  $str = $ti->str_by_varname( $varname )
    Returns the value of the flag, number or string capability of the given
    varname.

  @capnames = $ti->flag_capnames
  @capnames = $ti->num_capnames
  @capnames = $ti->str_capnames
    Return lists of the capnames of the supported flags, numbers, and
    strings

  @varnames = $ti->flag_varnames
  @varnames = $ti->num_varnames
  @varnames = $ti->str_varnames
    Return lists of the varnames of the supported flags, numbers, and
    strings

TODO
    This distribution provides a small accessor interface onto terminfo. It
    was originally created simply so I can get at the "bce" capability flag
    of the current terminal, because screen unlike every other terminal
    ever, doesn't do this. Grrr.

    It probably also wants more accessors for things like "tparm" and
    "tputs". I may at some point consider them.
